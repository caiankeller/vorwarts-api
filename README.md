# **Getting into it**

## **Why?** 

Vorw√§rts was born to be an easy way to get books in the public domain, free of any publicity and completely transparent. The ideology of Vorw√§rts is to maintain the neutrality of all these books written by incredible authors and which now belong to everyone.

## **Root**

**`https://vorwartsapi.herokuapp.com`**

## **EndPoints**

- [x] /books
- [ ] /genres
- [ ] /authors
- [ ] /years...

Well, so...

### **/books**
`GET` | Books

**params**

Optional parameters

* `Title`
* `Author`
* `Year` *Year of publication. Ex.: {"year": "1984"}*
* `Country` *Stands for the country where the book was originally published. The short version of the name should be used. Ex.: {"country": "Germany"}*
* `Language` *Language originally written, the download options will usually be in the same language* 
* `Genres` *CAUTIONüôÉ,  a slightly different field. To pass more than one gender, divide it into commas. Ex.: {"genres": "Fantasy, Children's Book"}*
* `Limit` *stands for limit of books per request. The default limit is 10*
* `Offset` *Skip the first books.*
* `Groupby` *Group books by field. Try: author, genres, year, country or language. Ex.: {"groupby": "author"}*

Required parameters

* There are no required parameters here, not even tokens or rate limits(For now, be kind and respectful).

### **Basically**

```javascript
axios.get("https://vorwartsapi.herokuapp.com/books", {
    params: {
      author: "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
      groupby: "author"
    }
  })
```

### **If all goes well, expect something like that**

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"data": [
		{
			"author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
			"books": [
				{
					"downloads": [],
					"_id": "61ba1d7e24a1157ef54f1220",
					"title": "The Sorrows of Young Werther",
					"author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
					"genres": [
						"Epistolary novel"
					],
					"language": "German",
					"country": "Germany",
					"year": 1774
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

### **If not üò≥**

The most common errors (the only ones, to be honest) that the application can respond to are

`404` This means that the application has not found any books in these specifications.

`406` This means that the group by selected attribute is not enabled.

But we responded with a nice json saying what exactly happened.

```json
{
	"ok": false,
	"message": "no book has found"
}
```

## **"But I want to help"**

* ### **"I program":**

üòÆ‚Äçüí® Ufa.

Just make a pull request. I don't know to manage a project. But soon as possible, I deploy it at heroku. The project follows MVC pattern. You just need to configure the dotenv file in the `/src`.

`BD_URL = `

`node src/app.js` to run 

* ### **"I don't program":**

We'll be back for you, I promise <3. Since you're on GitHub, if you know how to commit, any help with bringing new books to Vorw√§rts is welcome in the [library](https://github.com/vonweinkeller/vorwarts-library)  repository. Just be careful and pay attention to whether the book is in the public domain and whether there is copyright on the translation.

## **Issues**

- [ ] All paramedics are case sensitive, which makes the request more likely to respond with no book. A solution will be implemented as soon as I discover a good one.
- [ ] Find more issues to put here.
