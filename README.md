# **Getting into it**

## **Why?** 

Vorw√§rts was born to be an easy way to get books in the public domain, free of any publicity and completely transparent. The ideology of Vorw√§rts is to maintain the neutrality of all these books written by incredible authors and which now belong to everyone.

## **Root**

**`https://vorwartsapi.herokuapp.com`**

## **EndPoints**

- [x] /books
- [ ] /genres
- [ ] /authors
- [ ] /years...

Well, so...

    params: {
      author: "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
      groupby: "author"
    }
  })
```

### **If everything gonne right, expect for something like**

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"data": [
		{
			"author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
			"books": [
				{
					"downloads": [],
					"_id": "61ba1d7e24a1157ef54f1220",
					"title": "The Sorrows of Young Werther",
					"author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",
					"genres": [
						"Epistolary novel"
					],
					"language": "German",
					"country": "Germany",
					"year": 1774
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

### **If not üò≥**

The most commons(the onlys, to be honest) erros that the app can response is

`404` It means that hasn't found any book in the specifications.

`406` It means that the groupby selected attribute are not enable.

But we response with a beautiful json with the information

```json
{
	"ok": false,
	"message": "no book has found"
}
```

## **"But I want to help"**

* ### **"I programm":**

üòÆ‚Äçüí® Ufa.

Just make a pull request. I don't know to manage a project. But soon as possible, I deploy it at heroku. The project follows MVC pattern. You just need to configure the dotenv file in the `/src`.

`BD_URL = `

* ### **"I don't programm":**
We'll come back for you, I promise <3. Since you're in the GitHub, if you know to commit, any help bringing new books to Vorwa√§rts are welcome in the [library](https://github.com/vonweinkeller/vorwarts-library) repository. Be carefully and attends if the book is in the public domain and translations copyrights.
